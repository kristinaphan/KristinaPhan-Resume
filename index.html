        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Growing up, I never had much interest in any specific career and was lost, that is until I learned about geology in fourth grade. Even though I distinctly remember geology igniting my interest in the sciences, I canâ€™t quite recall why it did. From there, I found more of my interests in science, such as anatomy, pathology, immunology, ecology, and more throughout my education before undergrad. For this, I am grateful since I was able to find my interests and my passion earlier on so I was able to participate in different activities and clubs before undergrad. During high school, I determined that I wanted to be a forensic pathologist and with that knowledge, I joined mock trial. Even though mock trial is primarily for those who are interested in the law route, I personally made the decision to join because I had the understanding that forensic pathologists sometimes had to appear in court. Growing up, I was always nervous whenever it came to public speaking and I thought that mock trial would help ease me out of the fear I had. With all the time spent in mock trial, I was definitely able to take away a lot from it. From this experience, I was able to strengthen my public speaking skills as well as thinking quickly on my feet. My role in mock trial was as a witness, which required me to learn the backstory and facts inside and out so that when the lawyer asked me a question, I had to quickly formulate an answer based on the information given to me. 
<br>

        In addition to mock trial, I also joined some volunteering clubs and did some internships. The one that stood out to me the most was my internship at Kaiser Permanente. From that experience, I was able to determine that pathology is a career that I would like to pursue in the future. Even though the pathology department was not an option for assignment, I still was lucky enough to be able to visit and learn more from the pathologists there. During the entirety of this internship, I was assigned to the Dermatology department which was a specialty that I had never gotten much exposure to or held much interest for. I was lucky enough to be able to have exposure to dermatology and learn about different procedures that doctors follow for different treatments. In addition, I was also exposed to the procedures of emailing and calling patients and informing them about potential treatments. 
<br><br>

        Moving forward a few years later, I worked in retail at Marshallâ€™s. Working here gave me a different perspective because I was able to closely interact with customers whereas my other experiences had me working from a distance. I am now a fourth- year undergrad student at University of California, Riverside (UCR) studying Biology with a minor in Philosophy. As of now, I am still pursuing Forensic Pathology.
